<ol>
<li>Validate that you are selecting the appropriate billing account for this experiment request.  Billing will be performed electronically during the first week of each month
</li>
<li>Print out a copy of the Agilent Quality Control Request form and bring it with your samples to the Microarray Core Facility (Huntsman Cancer Institute Room 3350). The samples should be placed in the racks located on the bottom shelf of the -80&#176;C freezer.  Place the sample request form in the folder that is attached to the freezer.
</li>
<li>Inscribe the 'sample #' found on the Sample Quality Request form on the lids of sample tubes.  You may print the sample name, your name or other identifiers on the side of sample tubes.

</li>
<li>The RNA Nano Chip provides a qualitative assessment of the integrity of a total RNA sample.  The bioanalyzer software also provides a quantitative estimate of the sample and calculates the 28S/18S ribosomal RNA ratio.  This chip has been optimized for a quantity of total RNA that ranges from 25 to 500 ng. 
</li>
<li>Provide a volume of 3 &#181;l of purified total RNA in water (or TE) at a concentration between 25 ng/&#181;l and 500 ng/&#181;l for samples to be run on the Bioanalyzer RNA 6000 Nano Chip. 
</li>
<li>Do not send a sample volume/quantity in excess of the guidelines above.  We are unable to provide a long term storage solution for excess samples.  The unused portion of these samples is discarded after the experiment has been successfully completed.
</li>
<li>The GNomEx database (Microarray and Illumina Sequencing LIMS) will communicate the progress of key steps in the experimental process (i.e. quality control, completion of experiment request) by e-mail notification.  Click the following link to access GNomEx:
<a href='http://www.huntsmancancer.org/internal/microarrayOrdering.html'>http://www.huntsmancancer.org/internal/microarrayOrdering.html</a>. 
</li>
<li>Bioanalyzer Data can be downloaded from GNomEx by clicking on the 'Experiments' tab, selecting the experiment request of interest, clicking the download link and selecting the desired folders to download.
</li>
