<ol>
<li>Validate that you are selecting the appropriate billing account for this experiment request.  Billing will be performed electronically during the first week of each month
</li>
<li>Print out a copy of the Agilent Microarray Request form and bring it with your samples to the Microarray Core Facility (Huntsman Cancer Institute Room 3350). The samples should be placed in the racks located on the bottom shelf of the -80&#176;C freezer.  Place the sample request form in the folder that is attached to the freezer.
</li>
<li>Inscribe the 'sample #' found on the Agilent Microarray Request form on the lids of sample tubes.  You may print the sample name, your name or other identifiers on the side of sample tubes.

</li>
<li>A volume of 25 &#181;l of genomic DNA sample adjusted to a concentration of 75-150 ng/&#181;l is required for either 1M or 244K CGH microarrays.  A volume of 25 &#181;l of genomic DNA sample adjusted to a concentration of 50-75 ng/&#181;l is required for either 105K or 44K CGH microarrays.  It is preferred that you provide a quantity on the high end of these concentration ranges.
</li>
<li>Do not send a sample volume/quantity in excess of the guidelines above.  We are unable to provide a long term storage solution for excess samples.  The unused portion of these samples is discarded after the experiment has been successfully completed.
</li>
<li>The GNomEx database (Microarray and Illumina Sequencing LIMS) will communicate the progress of key steps in the experimental process (i.e. quality control, completion of experiment request) by e-mail notification.  Click the following link to access GNomEx:
<a href='https://bioserver.hci.utah.edu/microarrayweb/ordering.html'>https://bioserver.hci.utah.edu/microarrayweb/ordering.html</a>. 
</li>
<li>Data can be downloaded from GNomEx by clicking on the 'Experiments' tab, selecting the experiment request of interest, clicking the download link and selecting the desired folders to download.
</li>
